# This file is auto-generated at container startup from Docker environment
#
# To add new environment variables for cron jobs:
# 1. Add them to your docker-compose.yml or .env file
# 2. Add them to the CRON_ENV_VARS list in entrypoint.sh

# Placeholder - this file is regenerated at container start
# with actual values from the Docker environment
